Git             : a version control system

GitHub           : platform to host remote repositories

Local Repository : folder to keep track of changes locally, on each device

Remote Repository : folder online that keeps track of changes, but also can have changes of others

un-versioned      : not being kept track of

commit            : saved my changes to my local repository

push              : sending the changes in the local repository to the remote repository
